// Someone is asked to perform the following operations on a randomly chosen number between 1 and 10.

Step 1: Double the chosen number.

Step 2: Add a number K(even number given as input) to the number obtained after Step1

Step 3: Divide the obtained number in Step 2 by 2.

Step 4: Now subtract the obtained number in Step 3 with the original chosen number N

Your task is to find the answer obtained at the end of Step 4 ,i.e,at the end of all the mentioned operations performed on the number chosen.

        //CODE//            

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
int n,z,f,g;
    scanf("%d",&n);
    if(n>=1 && n<=10){
      z=  n+n;
       f= z+n;
       g= f/2;
       printf("%d",g-n);
    } 
    return 0;
}
